```{r}
# The code below will bring in the enrollment by race/ethnicity data
# It will then filter to only include one school district (Baker SD 5J)
# It then use select() to drop a few columns that we don't need

  read_rds("https://github.com/rfortherestofus/going-deeper-v2/raw/main/data/enrollment_by_race_ethnicity.rds") |>

# Use pivot_wider() to make the race/ethnicity groups into the columns (keep year in rows)
# Then create a table with the flextable or gt package
# Work on adjusting your column names, column width, number formatting, 
# and anything else you might want to try out.
